# 📘 SQL & T-SQL
 
It covers **SQL & T-SQL concepts from basic to advanced** that are essential for real-world database work.

---

| Level | Topic / Concept | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Beginner (Basics)** | Database Fundamentals (Tables, Rows, Columns, Keys) | Foundation for all SQL work |
|  | Data Types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, DECIMAL, etc.) | Essential for designing schemas |
|  | `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` | 80% of queries use these |
|  | `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT` | Basic sorting & uniqueness |
|  | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | CRUD operations = backbone of apps |
|  | Primary Key & Foreign Key | Core for data relationships |
| **Intermediate (Core SQL)** | `JOINs` (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) | 80% of relational queries need joins |
|  | `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, Aggregates (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) | Summarizing data for reports |
|  | Subqueries (Scalar, Correlated) | Solves complex queries |
|  | Indexing (Clustered, Non-Clustered) | 80% performance tuning comes from indexes |
|  | Views (Simple, Indexed) | Encapsulation & reusable queries |
|  | Transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) | Data consistency & reliability |
|  | Constraints (CHECK, UNIQUE, DEFAULT) | Enforces data integrity |
| **Advanced (T-SQL Specific)** | Stored Procedures | 80% of business logic runs here |
|  | Functions (Scalar, Table-Valued) | Code reusability inside SQL |
|  | Triggers | Automation on data changes |
|  | CTE (Common Table Expressions) | Cleaner recursive & hierarchical queries |
|  | Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`) | Advanced reporting & analytics |
|  | Dynamic SQL (`sp_executesql`) | Needed for flexible apps |
|  | Error Handling (`TRY...CATCH`) | Ensures reliability |
| **Expert (Professional)** | Performance Tuning (Execution Plans, Statistics, Index Optimization) | Saves 80% of query time |
|  | Partitioning & Sharding | Scales large databases |
|  | Temp Tables vs Table Variables | Optimizes memory use |
|  | Cursors | Row-by-row operations (last resort) |
|  | SQL Server Agent Jobs | Automating tasks |
|  | Security (Roles, Permissions, Encryption) | Must-have for enterprise apps |
|  | Advanced T-SQL Features (`MERGE`, `OUTPUT`, JSON, XML) | Modern data handling |
|  | ETL & Integration (SSIS, Bulk Insert) | Needed for large-scale data migration |
| **Mastery (Real-World)** | Query Optimization (Index Hints, CTE vs Temp vs Derived Tables) | Real-world performance |
|  | High Availability (Replication, Mirroring, Always On) | Mission-critical systems |
|  | Advanced Data Warehousing (OLAP, Cube, Star Schema) | Enterprise reporting |
|  | Stored Procedure Optimization (Parameter sniffing fixes) | Crucial for big apps |
|  | Partitioned Views, Filegroups | Handle billions of rows |
|  | Cloud Databases (Azure SQL, AWS RDS) | Modern production environments |
