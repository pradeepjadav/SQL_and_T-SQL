---

### üèÜ Mastery (Enterprise & Cloud)

| Topic | Why It Matters (80/20 Benefit) | Practice Focus |
|-------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Query Optimization (Index Hints, Derived vs CTE vs Temp) | Real-world performance tuning | Optimize EF Core query |
| High Availability (Replication, Always On) | Mission-critical uptime | Configure read-only replica |
| Advanced Warehousing (OLAP, Cube, Star Schema) | Enterprise reporting | Build a star schema |
| Stored Procedure Optimization (Parameter sniffing fixes) | Fix real perf. issues | Tune heavy SP |
| Partitioned Views, Filegroups | Handle billions of rows | Archival design |
| Cloud Databases (Azure SQL, AWS RDS) | Modern production | Deploy DB to Azure SQL |

---

## üîó .NET Integration (Bridge Layer)

| Area | Concept | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **ADO.NET** | `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataReader`, `SqlDataAdapter` | Low-level DB access from .NET |
| **Entity Framework Core** | Code-First vs DB-First, LINQ ‚Üí SQL, Migrations | ORM for modern .NET apps |
| **Stored Procedures + EF** | Mapping SP results | Blend SQL & EF logic |
| **Transactions** | `TransactionScope` in .NET | Reliable multi-queries |
| **Best Practices** | Parameterized queries, Caching | Prevent SQL injection & improve perf |

‚úÖ Practice: Connect your **Task Manager DB** to a **.NET 9 Web API** using EF Core.

---

## üõ† Real-World Development Layer

SQL & T-SQL are not just for queries ‚Äî they are the backbone of **enterprise applications**.  
Here‚Äôs how they fit into real-world development:

| Area | Real-World Application | Example |
|------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Backend APIs** | Efficient queries for REST APIs | Task API fetching filtered results |
| **Business Logic in DB** | Stored Procedures, Triggers, Functions | Auto-calculate invoice totals |
| **Reports & Analytics** | Aggregates, CTEs, Window Functions | Weekly sales reports |
| **Performance Tuning** | Indexing, Execution Plans, Statistics | Optimize slow-running dashboard |
| **Data Migration & ETL** | SSIS, Bulk Insert, Linked Servers | Import legacy data into SQL Server |
| **Security** | Roles, Permissions, Encryption | Role-based access for multi-tenant apps |
| **Cloud Integration** | Azure SQL, AWS RDS | Deploy database to Azure SQL PaaS |
| **CI/CD & DevOps** | SQL scripts in pipelines | Automated DB migrations with EF Core |
| **Auditing & Logging** | Triggers & History tables | Keep track of changes for compliance |

‚úÖ Practice: Take your **Task Manager DB** ‚Üí Connect it to a **.NET Web API** ‚Üí Add stored procedures, indexes, and security ‚Üí Deploy to **Azure SQL**.

## üéØ Interview Preparation (SQL & T-SQL)

When interviewing for **.NET + SQL developer roles**, you‚Äôll face both **theory** and **practical query challenges**.

### üîë Core Interview Topics
- **SQL Basics**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`
- **Advanced SQL**: Window Functions, CTEs, Subqueries
- **T-SQL Features**: Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, Error Handling
- **Optimization**: Indexing, Execution Plans, Query Hints
- **Transactions**: ACID properties, Deadlocks, Isolation Levels
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Reporting queries, performance tuning, handling large data
- **.NET Integration**: Using ADO.NET, EF Core, parameterized queries, handling SPs

### ‚ùì Common Interview Questions
1. Difference between **INNER JOIN** vs **LEFT JOIN**?  
2. How do you find the **second-highest salary** from a table?  
3. Explain **Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**.  
4. How do you handle **deadlocks** in SQL Server?  
5. Difference between **DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP**?  
6. When would you use a **CTE vs Subquery**?  
7. Explain **transaction isolation levels** in SQL Server.  
8. How do you debug a **slow query** in SQL Server?  
9. Difference between **Table Variable vs Temp Table**.  
10. How to call a **Stored Procedure** from .NET (ADO.NET / EF Core)?  

### üßë‚Äçüíª Practical Coding Challenges
- Write a query to get the **top 3 orders per customer** using Window Functions.  
- Find users who have **not logged in during the last 30 days**.  
- Create a query that shows **hierarchical employee ‚Üí manager ‚Üí director structure**.  
- Optimize a query that scans millions of rows (using indexes, execution plans).  

‚úÖ Tip: In interviews, they care more about **how you think** (query design, optimization approach) than just raw syntax.
